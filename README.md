# HTTP Response Machine ðŸ¤–

Raw HTTP response to a URL

Demo: [https://response.ee](https://response.ee)\
(http:// also supported)

Ideas:

- frontend: highlight all escape sequences in user input, e.g. `\r`, `\u0061`; more examples
- backend: less hacky setup? (decouple serving static files and response generation)
